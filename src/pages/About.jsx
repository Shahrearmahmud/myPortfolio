          "I have successfully completed my Computer Science and Engineering degree from NUB. Over the past three years, I have immersed myself in web development, tackling programming challenges across various languages. Additionally, I have honed my expertise in data structures and algorithms. Despite my academic commitments, I haven't had the opportunity to join or apply to any software companies. I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge gained both academically and professionally in a dynamic work environment ."
